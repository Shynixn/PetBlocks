# All items which are rendered inside the inventory. You need to specify the item you want to display and the position.
# For more complex GUIs, you may want to show different items on the same position depending on a certain condition:
#  e.g. pet is spawned, show despawn button
#  e.g. pet is not spawned, show spawn button
# You can achieve that using the 'condition' property below.
# If multiple conditions are true for a single position, the last item in the list wins and is being displayed.
